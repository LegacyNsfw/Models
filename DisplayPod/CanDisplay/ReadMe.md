# Gauge Pod Software 

Designed for the following hardware:

* Processor: SeeedStudio's Xiao SAMD21 
* CanBus: SeeedStudio's Xiao CanBus expansion board
* Display: Adafruit's 1.8" TFT LCD + MicroSD board (ST7735R)

As I write this I'm waiting for PCBs from Aisler that will hopefully make it pretty simple to assemble everything.
